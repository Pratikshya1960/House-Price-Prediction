# House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using a dataset of properties in Bangalore, India. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to estimate property prices accurately.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following steps:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, cleaning data, and transforming features for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to identify patterns and insights.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and selecting important ones for prediction.
4. **Model Building and Evaluation**: Training machine learning models and evaluating their performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Bengaluru_House_Data.csv`, which contains the following columns:

- `area_type`: The type of the area (e.g., Super built-up Area, Plot Area).
- `availability`: Availability date (e.g., Ready to Move, date).
- `location`: Location of the property.
- `size`: Size of the property (e.g., 2 BHK, 4 Bedroom).
- `society`: Name of the society (if available).
- `total_sqft`: Total square feet area.
- `bath`: Number of bathrooms.
- `balcony`: Number of balconies.
- `price`: Price of the property (in lakhs).

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or above).
3. Install the required libraries listed above.
4. Place the `Bengaluru_House_Data.csv` file in the same directory as the notebook.
5. Open the Jupyter Notebook `House Price Prediction.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.

## Results

The project demonstrates the following outcomes:
- Insights about property price distribution, size, and location trends in Bangalore.
- A trained machine learning model capable of predicting house prices based on input features.

## Future Improvements

- Use additional datasets for better generalization.
- Incorporate advanced models like XGBoost or Neural Networks for improved accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
